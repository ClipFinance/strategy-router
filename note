--------- exchange contract with routing --------- 
1) Needs a function to route swap through predefined dex such as pancakeswap or acryptos, maybe some other in future.
    - this would be useful in strategy router as we may have different stables, some of them can be swapped on acryptos to save on fees and slippage.
2) AcryptoS pool is relatively hard to integrate on-chain.
    - good to know that they have multiple stableswap metapools, and one base pool ACS4USD. We only use UST metapool for now, to add new pools will need to add new DexType, setup coinIds and dexTypes mappings via setter functions. 

So possible implementation in general: 
1) when calling swapRouted we will get DexType for these two tokens. If DexType not set for them we use default route which is pancakeswap with intermediary WETH.
2) Function to swap on certain DexType directly, by passing dex type as argument.

If we need to add more dex types then we should have possibility to replace Exchange contract with new version in every other contract that depends on it.

* consider to use swap path for bsw to ust and busd to be bsw -> weth on biswap router, then weth to ust on pancake, that's due to liquidity amounts

    - deposit -
1) approve router to transfer UST & busd
2) call add_liquidity on router and receive LP tokens

3) approve farm to transfer BSW LP tokens
4) call function on farm: deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount)
    (_pid should be 18)

    - harvest and reinvest -
5) harvest BSW tokens by call to withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount) need to pass _amount 0 to harvest
6) swap BSW to more UST & BUSD
7) go to step 1

    - withdraw -
8) call withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount) _amount is lp tokens
    strategy-router will provide us amount of usd to withdraw, we need to get its value in LP tokens so we can proceed.
    use formula from here https://cmichel.io/pricing-lp-tokens/

9) swap LP tokens to ust

* farm's deposit and withdraw functions always harvest internally

--- try to change functions from using getAmountsOut to a better way to price LPs and vice versa. Mentioned function accounts for fee, but totalTokens should not do that. 

* need to think more about the fact that strategies rely on Exchange contract for swaps, but then inside function such as totalTokens they rely on dex and pools that are predefined in these strategies, so it can be easy to break something if not knowing that. I think of two options: 
1) to have also 'quote' and 'getAmountsOut' functions on Exchange contract that will use dex based on pair provided. This sounds like a big field for bugs.
2) make strategies to not rely on Exchange contract at all (so only StrategyRouter will do as it don't use 'quote' and similar functions), this way if we would have 5 strategies with the similar tokens, we would need to copy paste code related to swaps & getAmounts...

For now just use Exchange for swaps, and 'quote' from dex predefined in strategy, though its a must to sync dex used on exchange and in strategy!

    - deposit -
1) approve zap depositer contract to transfer UST
2) call add_liquidity on depositer and receive LP tokens

    function description:
    @notice Wrap underlying coins and deposit them in the pool
    @param amounts List of amounts of underlying coins to deposit
    @param min_mint_amount Minimum amount of LP tokens to mint from the deposit
    @return Amount of LP tokens received by depositing

3) approve ACryptoSFarmV4 to transfer ACS4UST LP tokens
4) call function on ACryptoSFarmV4: deposit(address _lpToken, uint256 _amount)

    - harvest and reinvest -
5) harvest ACS tokens by call to harvest(address _lpToken)
6) swap ACS to more UST
7) go to step 1

    - withdraw -
8) call withdraw(address _lpToken, uint256 _amount) _amount is lp tokens
    strategy-router will provide us amount of usd to withdraw, we need to get its value in LP tokens so we can proceed. because withdraw function takes lp token amount as argument. use calc_token_amount for that.
9) swap LP tokens to ust and transfer

    - totalTokens function -
1) use calc_token_amount function, it says it accounts for slippage but not fees, which should be ok

* Useful function in pool for calculation profits(as they said in the following doc-comments): 
    def get_virtual_price() -> uint256:
    """
    @notice The current virtual price of the pool LP token
    @dev Useful for calculating profits
    @return LP token virtual price normalized to 1e18
    """

-------
if totalTokens uses calc_withdraw_one_coin & calc_token_amount which accounts for slippage, then for 1 LP we get number like 1.099 (and for 1.0 usd we would get 0.99 LP) but if instead we use get_virtual_price to convert LP to tokens and vice versa, then we would get amounts without slippage, the question is which method to use. 

if use calc_withdraw_one_coin and calc_token_amount:

user withdraw 100 tokens, 
use calc_token_amount to convert to LP (accounts for slippage)
withdrawAmount would be 99.9 LP
now user got 99.9 and on farm leftover is 0.1 LP
so from each withdraw there is small leftover ammount.


if use get_virtual_price:

user withdraw 100 tokens, 
use get_virtual_price to convert to LP 
withdrawAmount would be 100 LP (but can it be bigger such as 101.0? not sure, Curve pool math is quite hard)
now user got 100 and on farm leftover is 0.0 LP

test: after withdraw all tokens, only withdraw function has math based on virtual price, lefover on farm
on farm LPs 1425101280499913967, totalTokens 1627105805945261011
(1.4 LP and 1.6 $)

test: all functions based on get_virtual_price
on farm LPs 1, totalTokens 1

looks like get_virtual_price approach works better without problems 

* if users deposited 100 + 100, then in withdraw they should not pass 100, it will not work. Instead withdraw amount should rely on totalTokens. This seems to be fine since StrategyRouter is using totalTokens to calculate shares and pps.

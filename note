TODO: disallow strategy-router usage from contracts to prevent flashloan attack, because we calculate lp prices it may be dangerous.

biswap router: https://bscscan.com/address/0x3a6d8ca21d1cf76f653a67577fa0d27453350dd8#code

    - deposit -
1) approve router to transfer UST & busd
2) call add_liquidity on router and receive LP tokens

3) approve farm to transfer BSW LP tokens
4) call function on farm: deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount)
    but first, need to find pid for our lp token though

    - harvest and reinvest -
5) harvest BSW tokens by call to deposit(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount) need to pass _amount 0 to harvest
6) swap BSW to more UST & BUSD
7) go to step 1

    - withdraw -
8) call withdraw(uint256 _pid, uint256 _amount) _amount is lp tokens
    strategy-router will provide us amount of usd to withdraw, we need to get its value in LP tokens so we can proceed.
    use formula from here https://cmichel.io/pricing-lp-tokens/

9) swap LP tokens to ust

NOTE: deposit and withdraw functions always harvest BSW tokens if there is any on farm

    - deposit -
1) approve zap depositer contract to transfer UST
2) call add_liquidity on depositer and receive LP tokens

    function description:
    @notice Wrap underlying coins and deposit them in the pool
    @param amounts List of amounts of underlying coins to deposit
    @param min_mint_amount Minimum amount of LP tokens to mint from the deposit
    @return Amount of LP tokens received by depositing

3) approve ACryptoSFarmV4 to transfer ACS4UST LP tokens
4) call function on ACryptoSFarmV4: deposit(address _lpToken, uint256 _amount)

    - harvest and reinvest -
5) harvest ACS tokens by call to harvest(address _lpToken)
6) swap ACS to more UST
7) go to step 1

    - withdraw -
8) call withdraw(address _lpToken, uint256 _amount) _amount is lp tokens
    strategy-router will provide us amount of usd to withdraw, we need to get its value in LP tokens so we can proceed. because withdraw function takes lp token amount as argument. use calc_token_amount for that.
9) swap LP tokens to ust and transfer

    - totalTokens function -
1) use calc_token_amount function, it says it accounts for slippage but not fees, which should be ok

* Useful function in pool for calculation profits(as they said in the following doc-comments): 
    def get_virtual_price() -> uint256:
    """
    @notice The current virtual price of the pool LP token
    @dev Useful for calculating profits
    @return LP token virtual price normalized to 1e18
    """
